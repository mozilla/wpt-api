# Mozilla wpt-api Documentation
(a.k.a **Using WebPageTest... _Mozilla Edition_**)

## Introduction
## Project Goals:
* Accurately measure, track, and report on key Firefox-performance metrics, over time
* Leverage, and be an integral part of, the [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) ecosystem

## Metrics & Metadata    

**Currently tracked metrics:**  

| metric | alt. name | units | type | derived |  
| :--: | :-------: | :---: | :--: | :--: |  
| ```domContentFlushed``` | dcf | ms | duration? | [```timeToDOMContentFlushed - fetchStart```](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/wptagent/pull/230/files) |    
| ```timeToFirstByte``` | TTFB | ms, sec | ... | ... |  
| ```timeToFirstNonBlankPaint``` | FNBP | ms, sec | ... | ... |  
| ```timeToFirstMeaningfulPaint``` | FMP | ms, sec | ... | ... |  
| ```timeToConsistentlyInteractive``` | n/a: non-spec | ... | ... | ... |  
| ```visualComplete``` | visually complete | ms, ? | ... | ... |  
| [ ```SpeedIndex``` ](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/metrics/speed-index) | Speed Index | ... | score | ... |   
| ```pageLoadTime``` | ```pageload``` in Raptor | ms, sec | duration | [```loadEventStart - fetchStart```](https://github.com/mozilla-services/cloudops-deployment/blob/5de5b9c90353b186e5ed1f0cb1b8f5e2296a988b/projects/wpt/puppet/modules/wpt/templates/settings/custom_metrics/pageLoadTime.js.epp) |  
| ```requestsFull``` |  ... | num | count | ... |  
| ```bytesInDoc``` | total bytes | num | count | ... |

**Test Metadata:**  

| name | type | value(s) |
| :---: | :--: | :------: |
| ```browser_version``` | _string_  |  "66.0a1" |   
| ```browser_name``` | _string_ | "Firefox Nightly" |  

### Manually Testing Metrics in Firefox
1. Enable/modify any (missing) prefs/pref-overrides
2. Open Tools -> Web Developer -> Web Console
3. Load a URL
4. After the page has "finished" loading, type something like: ```window.performance.timing.timeToFirstInteractive``` (**DO** take note of the other implemented/available metric options available as you autocomplete.)
5. Hit return/enter
6. You should see a value similar to ```1542438605479``` (time-stamped offset, in milliseconds)

PRO-TIPs: you can and *should* input ```window.performance.timing``` and/or ```performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")``` into the console, for the full data

### Adding Metrics to WebPageTest with Firefox
1. Manually test the metric + prefs; most metrics can be found in the following Firefox DOM WebIDL:  [```mozilla-central/dom/webidl/PerformanceTiming.webidl```](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/dom/webidl/PerformanceTiming.webidl)
2. If needed, add/modify Firefox's `prefs.js`, via a PR to  [```wptagent/internal/support/Firefox/profile/prefs.js```](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/wptagent/blob/3f2128a9815838f462187b870be3c666ebd13d95/internal/support/Firefox/profile/prefs.js)
 * Example: https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/wptagent/pull/181/files#diff-69b0882d86377063fd0514c0dc978308
3. Additionally, we might need to have the metric (if not available via standard APIs) emitted in WebPageTest, in [```wptagent/internal/js/page_data.js```](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/wptagent/blob/3f2128a9815838f462187b870be3c666ebd13d95/internal/js/page_data.js#L27).
 * Example: https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/wptagent/pull/230

# Infrastructure
### WebPageTest Instance (*Mozilla-internal*)
* https://wpt.stage.mozaws.net - Auth0/OAuth
* https://wpt-api.stage.mozaws.net - Basic Auth
   * (You'll need to file a bug in Cloud Ops, requesting access from either :jbuck or :jrgm

To run a test via the API, using our **internal instance** at [wpt-api.stage.mozaws.net](https://wpt-api.stage.mozaws.net/), is something like:  
```
$ webpagetest test www.twitch.tv  --server https://username:passkey@wpt-api.stage.mozaws.net --location us-east-1-linux:Firefox --bodies --keepua -r 3 --first --reporter json
```

To run the same test, but using the **public instance** now at [www.webpagetest.org](https://www.webpagetest.org), would be:

```
$ webpagetest test www.twitch.tv -k your_API_key --location ec2-us-east-1:Firefox --bodies --keepua -r 3 --first --reporter json
```

### Jenkins
* [```https://qa-preprod-master.fxtest.jenkins.stage.mozaws.net/job/wpt/```](https://qa-preprod-master.fxtest.jenkins.stage.mozaws.net/job/wpt/)
   * To obtain access, see these (internal-only) [Mana docs](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/TestEngineering/qa-preprod-master.fxtest.jenkins.stage.mozaws.net)

### AWS EC2 Setup
* **1** ```c5.xlarge``` __WebPageTest__ core server-instance (Linux, EC2 AMI ID: ami-024df0ababa7118ae)
* **6** x ```c5.xlarge``` __wptagent__ server instances (Linux, EC2 AMI ID: ami-a88c20d5)
