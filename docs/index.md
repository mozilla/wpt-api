# Mozilla wpt-api Documentation
## (a.k.a Using WebPageTest...Mozilla Edition)

## Introduction
## Project Goals:
* Accurately measure, track, and report on key Firefox-performance metrics, over time
* Leverage, and be an integral part of, the WebPageTest ecosystem

## High-Priority Needs:
### Metrics & timings/results' stability, repeatability
* Established/accepted baseline metrics; both 1) which ones, as well as 2) acceptable performance targets, benchmarks, budgets, etc.
* Standard Deviation for key metrics
* Easily-vetable and comparable runs

## Recommendations:
* We should **very** closely follow: https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/,<br>
which **would "enable web developers to access, instrument, and retrieve various performance metrics from the full lifecycle of a web application."**
* Continue soliciting workflows/use-cases from multiple teams, weighed with ongoing refinements/feature work
* Perhaps we should include output of ```window.performance.timing``` (to compare/contrast with ```WebPageTest``` -reported timing data)

## Metrics & Metadata:

* "To-Spec?" is getting at: either/both:
  Metric implementation largely "matching" W3C / WHATWG, etc., (draft) specification/proposal/RFC...
  Mozilla and/or Chrome, WebPageTest, et al. general acceptance of a given metric, as-currently-is.  This might include early draft-spec feature branches, etc., 

### Manually Testing Metrics in Firefox
1. Enable/modify any (missing) prefs/pref-overrides
2. Open Tools -> Web Developer -> Web Console
3. Load a URL
4. After the page has "finished" loading, type something like: ```window.performance.timing.timeToFirstInteractive``` (**DO** take note of the other implemented/available metric options available as you autocomplete.)
5. Hit return/enter
6. You should see a value similar to ```1542438605479``` (time-stamped offset, in milliseconds) 

PRO-TIP: you can and *should* input ```window.performance.timing``` into the Console, to dump the entire PerformanceTiming object

**[XXX FIX ME - Upload a tantalizing screengrab, here]**

### Adding Metrics to WebPageTest with Firefox
1. Manually test the metric + pref (ahem); most metrics can be found in the following Firefox DOM WebIDL:  [```mozilla-central/dom/webidl/PerformanceTiming.webidl```](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/dom/webidl/PerformanceTiming.webidl)
2. If needed, add/modify Firefox's `prefs.js`, via a PR to  [```wptagent/internal/support/Firefox/profile/prefs.js```](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/wptagent/blob/3f2128a9815838f462187b870be3c666ebd13d95/internal/support/Firefox/profile/prefs.js)
  Example: https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/wptagent/pull/181/files#diff-69b0882d86377063fd0514c0dc978308
3. Additionally, we might need to have the metric (if not available via standard APIs) emitted in WebPageTest, in [```wptagent/internal/js/page_data.js```](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/wptagent/blob/3f2128a9815838f462187b870be3c666ebd13d95/internal/js/page_data.js#L27).

## WebPageTest Runs at Mozilla

This should be a mid-to-high level overview of pertinent Mozilla-specific goals, design considerations (challenges) and, as a brief overview, a visualization of our WPT ecosystem.
