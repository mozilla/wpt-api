This repo aims to build a useful, versatile WebPageTest setup, which is both out-of-the-box ready, and yet also configurable enough for multiple teams and use-cases.

Specifically, its primary aim is capturing, submitting, and visualizing web-performance metrics from a Firefox release build, run against the Firefox Accounts firstrun webpage.

The currently implemented workflow, on the ```master``` branch, supports:

* Passing in a custom ```PAGE_URL``` to override the hardcoded default[0]:
* Running tests against the URL with the following hardcoded parameters:
  - in the ```us-east-1-linux``` EC2 region
  - 5 times
  - recent Firefox release build, on Linux
  - using ```--first``` (no caching)
* Post-WebPageTest run, we export and archive its output (via Jenkins) as ```fxa-homepage.json```[1]
* Next, we filter for and extract[2]:
  - Time To First Byte (TTFB)
  - Time To Non-Blank Paint, aka ```firstPaint``` (firstPaint)
  - Start render (render)
  - Speed Index (SpeedIndex)
  - Total Bytes Transferred (bytesInDoc)
  - Visually Complete time (visualComplete)
  - Total # of Requests (requestsFull)
* Finally, the perf metrics are sent via a DataDog agent to its API[3], and are plotted, here:

Eventually, and roughly in order of complexity and dependencies, we aim for:

* batch-URL/command processing
* integration of perf metrics with code review (GitHub)/CI builds (TeamCity, Jenkins, Travis?), and post-deployment testing
